how to solve a problem using recursion
1. identify if you can breakdown the problem into small problems
2. draw the reccurence relation using if it is needed..
3. draw the recursive tree
4. about the tree
  > see the flow of function, how they are getting in stack 
  > identify and focus on left and right tree calls
  > draw the tree pointer again and again using pen and paper.
  > use the debugger to see the flow of program
5. see how the values and what type of values are returned at each step
   see where two function calls will come out of where it called previously
